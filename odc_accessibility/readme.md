# ODC Interactivity and accessibility improvements

## Goal
Develop new and existing tools for notebook interactivity and visualisation - reduce the need to go outside the JupyterLab environment to gain insights from spatial data

## Objectives
- Identify areas that need improvement + new features
- Improve shapefile mapping on basemaps - [github issue](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/issues/477)
- Develop capability for xarray plotting over basemaps using ipyleaflet - [example](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet/blob/master/examples/Numpy.ipynb)
- Improve area selection code - [github](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/pull/482)
- Reverse geocoding implementation, maybe using [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy)
- Add timeouts to interactive tools to allow testing with no user input - [github](https://github.com/opendatacube/odc-tools/issues/31)
- Integrate new functionality into a selection of existing notebooks
