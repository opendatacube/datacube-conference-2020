# Digital Earth Africa Notebooks  
## Motivations
One of the ‘lessons learned’ from the ARDC was the importance of developing a ‘knowledge bank’ where users can share knowledge on addressing environmental change problems, and consider strategies for developing new or adapted algorithms.  To this end, DE Africa needs to build a central github repository of notebooks that support training and extends the analysis capability of the platform. 
This repo and the included jupyter notebooks will form an important part of the transition of ARDC users to the DE Africa platform and can encourage uptake and knowledge sharing by providing read-to-use analysis tools.  

## Objectives
Tasks:
- Refresh/refactor some existing ARDC notebooks to work on the DE Africa platform.
- Standardize documentation and implement best practice for ODC.
- Build new ‘case-study’ notebooks that address thematic areas identified as important by the user base.  Potentially these could be centred around one or more SDGs
- Link this hack with Syed’s Water Interoperability notebook
